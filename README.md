## Description

This project is an CSS exercise, it was created mostly using CSS Grid feature to position various elements. It was also great practice for handling SVG's.

None of the links outside the credit link in 'Disclaimer' card are functional. That is on purpose, as there is no more content where they should lead to. 

**This project has been adjusted to be mobile friendly as well, although zooming out on mobile phone is required.**
